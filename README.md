# @jv-learning
Hi! My name is Juan Vieira, I'm the Tech Lead at a startup in Australia by day and a teacher/mentor/creator by night

Here you'll find all the courses, tutorials and projects I use, please feel totally free to use this content, reach out for any questions and collaborate!

jv-learning/jv-learning is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
